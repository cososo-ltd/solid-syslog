Feature: TLS equivalence matrix
  Given equivalent configuration, SolidSyslog reaches the same decision on
  every target - the same connect-or-refuse outcome, and the same portable
  detail code from enum SolidSyslogTlsStreamErrors. Each cell runs on every
  BDD lane, so one that passes has been proved against both TLS libraries,
  both collectors and every transport the library ships.

  The library that spoke is never asserted. It is the one thing that is
  supposed to differ.

  Scenario: A peer signed by the trusted anchor and named as expected is authorised
    Given the syslog oracle is running
    And the collector presents "anchor-signed"
    When the BDD target sends a syslog message with transport tls
    Then the syslog oracle receives 1 message over tls
    And the syslog oracle receives a message with priority "134"
    And the target reports no TLS fault

  Scenario: A pinned certificate is authorised with no chain at all
    Given the syslog oracle is running
    And the collector presents "self-signed"
    And the BDD target trusts no certificate authority
    And the fingerprint of "self-signed" is pinned
    When the BDD target sends a syslog message with transport tls
    Then the syslog oracle receives 1 message over tls
    And the target reports no TLS fault

  Scenario: A peer presented with its issuer satisfies both the anchor and the pin
    Given the syslog oracle is running

  @tls13
  Scenario: A device connects at TLS 1.3 to a collector that refuses anything older
    # Both oracles refuse everything below 1.3 on this listener - syslog-ng
    # through ssl-options, otelcol through min_version - so delivery is what
    # proves the version negotiated. The library has no 1.3 knob; it happens
    # because each backend prefers the highest mutually supported version.

  Scenario: A device the collector rejects after the handshake is told, rather than believing it delivered
    # Mutual TLS is decided after the client's flight under TLS 1.3, so the
    # write can succeed with the collector's refusal arriving behind it. Which
    # record surfaces the fault is a race between that refusal and the next
    # write, and it is not the same on every lane - one target sees the
    # handshake itself fail, the others deliver a record before learning. So
    # this cell asserts that the device is told, and deliberately not when. The
    # record already in flight when the collector refused it is unrecoverable.
