"""Steps for the TLS equivalence matrix.

The matrix asserts what the library did, not what the library it was built
against is called: the connect-or-refuse decision and the portable detail code
from `enum SolidSyslogTlsStreamErrors`, which since #813 is the same number on
every backend. `event->Source` is deliberately never asserted - it names the
library that spoke, which is the one thing that is supposed to differ.

What a cell configures before the target starts is here. What it does to a
running target is in syslog_steps.py with the rest of the client's vocabulary,
and the collector identities both need are in tls_collectors.py - one step
module cannot import another without behave registering its steps twice.
