"""The collector identities a TLS matrix cell can point a target at.

One row per identity: the port its listener answers on, and the certificate it
presents. Both oracles use the same port for the same identity
(Bdd/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf, Bdd/otel/config.yaml), so a scenario names the
identity and no feature file names a port or a file.

Plain data rather than steps, because the step module that configures a target
before it starts and the one that drives a running target both need it, and
behave registers a step module's steps twice if another imports it.
