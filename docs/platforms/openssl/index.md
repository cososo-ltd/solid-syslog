# OpenSSL

`Platform/OpenSsl/` wraps [OpenSSL](https://docs.openssl.org/) for TLS transport
and keyed at-rest cryptography on hosted targets. It fills the
[Stream](../../api/structSolidSyslogStream.md) role with TLS and the
[SecurityPolicy](../../api/structSolidSyslogSecurityPolicy.md) role for at-rest
integrity and confidentiality.

What a TLS stream must do is the same whichever library provides it, and is
stated once under [TLS obligations](../../tls.md). This page covers what this
adapter needs, how credentials reach it, and where it does not yet meet that
contract.

## What it ships

## Requirements

OpenSSL 3.0 or later. The CMake configure fails below that rather than the build,
so an older libssl is caught before anything compiles.

A `SolidSyslogSleepFunction` is required and has no default.

## Credentials come from a credentials source

Where trust anchors, pinned peer fingerprints and the mutual-TLS client
credential come from is the integrator's choice rather than this adapter's. The
stream is wired to a `SolidSyslogOpenSslCredentials`, asked once per connection
to install its material on the `SSL_CTX` and told once per connection when that
material is no longer needed. A source backed by a hardware key store, a
keyring or an encrypted store is a class implementing that role, and needs no
change here.

One source ships with the pack: `SolidSyslogOpenSslPemFileCredentials`, which
names its material by file path. It performs no file handling of its own -
the paths go to OpenSSL, which opens and parses them, so PEM bytes never pass
through this library. The key must not be encrypted: a passphrase is never
prompted for, so an encrypted key fails to load and is reported as
`CLIENT_CREDENTIAL_NOT_INSTALLED`.

The `SSL_CTX` is rebuilt on every open and freed on close, and the credentials
source is asked again each time. Nothing is held between connections. Rotation
is therefore a replacement and a reconnection: put the new material in place,
and it is in force on the next connection, either through ordinary reconnection
after an outage or immediately by moving the stream's configuration version.
Nothing has to be freed to rotate the shipped source, which names a path that
OpenSSL reads afresh on each connection, so the version is the whole of it.

## What it reports

Every class in this pack reports portable detail codes, so a handler written
against them keeps working if the crypto backend underneath changes. What stays
specific to this pack is `event->Source`, which names the class that reported.

Each role's codes are the whole vocabulary that role can express, so some
describe faults this pack cannot have and it never raises them.

From the TLS-stream codes it does not raise `DEFAULTS_NOT_APPLIED`, because
nothing here applies a library preset, or `NULL_RNG`, because OpenSSL carries its
own entropy source and the configuration asks for none.

From the credentials codes it does not raise `NULL_RNG` for the same reason, nor
`PEM_NOT_TERMINATED`, `TRUST_ANCHORS_NOT_PARSED` or `CLIENT_CREDENTIAL_NOT_PARSED`:
the shipped source names a path and hands it to OpenSSL, which reads and parses
the file itself, so a failure there arrives as `TRUST_ANCHORS_NOT_LOADED` or
`CLIENT_CREDENTIAL_NOT_INSTALLED` rather than as a parse of its own. Nor
`ALREADY_IN_USE`: the shipped source holds nothing between connections, so two
streams may share one.

The at-rest policies raise every code their roles define.

## What a connection is made with

The stream asks for a profile once per connection, and takes the expected peer
name and the cipher policy from it. Nothing is stored between connections, so a
change is a matter of returning something different and moving the stream's
version.

Both of OpenSSL's cipher lists are selectable, because it keeps two: one governs
TLS 1.2 and below, the other TLS 1.3, and since no protocol ceiling is pinned the
second is usually the one in force. Leave either unset and OpenSSL's own default
stands - for TLS 1.3 that is the suite RFC 8446 makes mandatory plus the two it
recommends. A list that selects nothing fails `Open` before any handshake and
is reported as `CIPHER_POLICY_REJECTED`, rather than falling back.

The security level is pinned at 2 after the policy is applied, so a list
carrying `@SECLEVEL=n` cannot lower it.

Key-exchange groups and signature algorithms are not selectable here. TLS 1.3
moved both out of the ciphersuite, so a policy naming a curve has nowhere to go
yet.

## Where it falls short of the contract

Nowhere. Every obligation under [TLS obligations](../../tls.md) is met by this
pack as shipped.
