# Mbed TLS

`Platform/MbedTls/` wraps [Mbed TLS](https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/) for TLS
transport and keyed at-rest cryptography on embedded targets. It fills the
[Stream](../../api/structSolidSyslogStream.md) role with TLS and the
[SecurityPolicy](../../api/structSolidSyslogSecurityPolicy.md) role for at-rest
integrity and confidentiality.

What a TLS stream must do is the same whichever library provides it, and is
stated once under [TLS obligations](../../tls.md). This page covers what this
adapter needs, how credentials reach it, the coexistence guarantee it makes, and
where it does not yet meet that contract.

## What it ships

## Requirements

The adapter sources compile in your target against your own `mbedtls_config.h`,
so the features you enable are the features it gets.

A `SolidSyslogSleepFunction` is required and has no default.

## Credentials come from a credentials source

Where trust anchors, pinned peer fingerprints and the mutual-TLS client
credential come from is the integrator's choice rather than this adapter's. The
stream is wired to a `SolidSyslogMbedTlsCredentials`, asked once per connection
to install its material on the `mbedtls_ssl_config` and told once per connection
when that material is no longer needed. A source backed by a security element, a
PSA opaque key or an encrypted store is a class implementing that role, and needs
no change here.

One source ships with the pack: `SolidSyslogMbedTlsHandleCredentials`, which
carries caller-built, caller-owned handles - an `mbedtls_x509_crt` trust chain,
and for mutual TLS an `mbedtls_x509_crt` and `mbedtls_pk_context` pair. No part
of the adapter opens a file, which is what allows it to run on targets built
without `MBEDTLS_FS_IO`.

The credential window is explicit. Install is called after the transport
connects; Release answers every Install, once, after the `ssl_config` has been
freed and with it every pointer into the material. A source that acquires
material per connection can therefore let go of it between connections, and one
carrying handles the integrator owns - the shipped source - keeps them for as
long as the integrator does.

Rotation with the shipped source is a disconnect and a re-parse: call
`SolidSyslogSender_Disconnect`, then free and re-parse into the same handle. The
next send reconnects with the new material. Freeing before the disconnect
completes is a use-after-free, because the open connection is still reading
it.

## Coexistence is an auditable contract

`Platform/MbedTls/Source/` calls no process-global Mbed TLS API. It does not call
`mbedtls_platform_setup` or `mbedtls_platform_teardown`, install threading-alt
hooks, call `psa_crypto_init`, reset the global random number generator, or
replace a debug callback. TLS policy is applied per `ssl_config`, so it cannot
affect the ones you build elsewhere. A device that already uses Mbed TLS for
firmware update or a vendor cloud SDK keeps that configuration intact, and the
claim can be checked against the directory.

## Where it differs from the contract

Each is tracked. Read them before relying on the corresponding obligation.

### A peer cannot be authorised by certificate fingerprint

Only certification path validation is offered, so a deployment with no PKI has no
way to pin the collector's certificate. Tracked as
[#753](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/753).

### The cipher policy cannot be expressed

The configuration carries no cipher or ciphersuite field, so the ciphersuites
your `mbedtls_config.h` enables, filtered by the preset, are what gets
negotiated. The contract asks for an integrator's policy to be passed through
where the library allows one to be selected. Tracked as
[#733](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/733).
