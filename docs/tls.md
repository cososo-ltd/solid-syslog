# TLS obligations

What a TLS `Stream` must do, whichever library provides it. Read this if you are
choosing between the TLS platforms, assessing the library against a security
standard, or writing a TLS `Stream` of your own.

The obligations here are the contract. What each shipped TLS platform actually
does, and where it differs, is on its own page - the
[capability matrix](platforms/index.md) shows which platforms fill the role.

## Delivery is preferred to silence

Syslog is how a device reports what happened to it. The moment the reporting
matters most is the moment the device is under attack, and that is also the
moment a security control that fails closed becomes a way to blind the collector.
An attacker who can block the route to a revocation responder, or who can make a
credential look half-configured, should not thereby be able to stop the device
reporting.

So the default is: **report the fault through the error handler, and keep
delivering.** A fault that an operator can see and act on is worth more than a
connection that refuses to open for a reason nobody is watching.

The rule has a limit: **delivery stops when the peer fails the check the
integrator asked for.** That covers a configuration naming neither trust anchors
nor pinned fingerprints, a certificate that does not validate against the trust
anchors, a certificate matching none of the configured fingerprints, and a
certificate that does not match a declared identity. Continuing through any of
them would hand the records to whoever answered instead, which loses the
confidentiality of the log and the audit trail at the same time, and does so
without anyone noticing.

The check is the integrator's to set. Declaring no peer identity is a decision
rather than a failure - it says chain verification alone is enough here, which on
a closed network with a private CA it may be. What the contract requires is that
the decision is explicit, and that the stream says so when it was never made at
all.

Everything else leaves you talking to the peer you trusted, holding a credential
you can no longer fully attest. Those are the faults that are reported while
delivery continues.

Where a store is configured, blocked delivery is delayed delivery rather than
lost delivery: records accumulate and replay on the next successful connection.
That bounds the cost of the exception without removing the reason for the rule,
because a store is finite and a SIEM that is blind now cannot alert now.

## The obligations

### Pin the protocol floor

A TLS `Stream` sets its own minimum protocol version rather than inheriting
whatever the TLS library was built to permit. Downgrade resistance is then a
property of this library rather than of the integrator's build of another one.
The floor is TLS 1.2.

No ceiling is required, and setting one would be wrong. RFC 9662, which updates
RFC 5425, asks that TLS 1.3 be supported and **preferred** where it is
implemented, so a stream that pinned a ceiling to constrain something else would
breach that. BCP 195 §3.1.1 says the same for TLS generally.

### Require a trust anchor or a pinned fingerprint

A peer is authorised in one of two ways, and a `Stream` requires at least one of
them. Configured with neither, it refuses to connect rather than talk to a peer
it cannot check. That is reported when a connection is attempted rather than when
the stream is created, because trust anchors are obtained per connection and a
stream cannot know at create time what its credential source will yield; the
timing rule is set out under *Check the configuration it cannot work without*.

**Certification path validation.** The peer certificate must chain to trust
anchors the integrator supplies. There is no fallback to a system trust store: an
embedded target may not have one, and on a host that store is a far larger trust
base than a device reporting to a single collector needs. Validity dates are part
of this check, not separate from it - RFC 5280 §6.1 makes the validity period an
input to path validation, so a certificate outside its own dates does not chain
and the connection stops.

**A pinned certificate fingerprint.** Covered in its own obligation below. A
certificate matched by fingerprint needs no chain: RFC 5425 §4.2.1 states that
such a certificate "can be self-signed, and no certification path validation is
needed".

Where both are configured, the peer must satisfy both. That is this contract's
choice, not a requirement of RFC 5425: §6.1 recommends that both endpoints be
authenticated and authorised by one of §5.1 or §5.2, rather than that the two be
combined. Requiring both where both are given is the safer reading of an
integrator who supplied both.

### Accept a peer authorised by certificate fingerprint

RFC 5425 §5.1 requires that a peer can be authorised by its certificate
fingerprint, not only by a chain to a trust anchor and a name. The two are
different tools: a fingerprint pins one certificate, which suits a closed network
with no PKI, where issuing and rotating a CA is more machinery than the
deployment wants.

The accepted form is the one RFC 5425 §4.2.2 defines: an ASCII hash label, a
colon, then the hash of the DER-encoded certificate as colon-separated uppercase
hex pairs. Labels come from the IANA
[Hash Function Textual Names](https://www.iana.org/assignments/hash-function-text-names/hash-function-text-names.xhtml)
registry and are hyphenated, so `sha-256` and `sha-1` rather than `sha256` or
`sha1`. A `Stream` accepts both of those algorithms. §4.2.2 makes SHA-1 mandatory
to support; `sha-256` is the one to configure where the collector offers a
choice.

A **list** of fingerprints is accepted, and any one of them authorises the peer.
A fingerprint covers the whole DER certificate, so it changes every time the
collector's certificate is renewed. Pinning the old and the new together is what
lets a fleet cross a renewal without every device stopping at once.

Where fingerprints are configured and the peer's certificate matches none of
them, the connection stops, whatever the chain says.

**A pin excuses the chain, not the clock.** A pinned certificate outside its
validity period is refused, in fingerprint-only mode exactly as in any other. A
pin says which certificate is expected, not that an expired one has become
acceptable. This is worth stating because it is easy to implement wrongly: both
backends express fingerprint-only mode as a verification callback that overrides
the untrusted-chain result, and a callback that overrides every result rather
than that one silently switches expiry checking off.

**Pinning makes the collector's expiry a fleet-wide event.** Every device pinned
to a certificate stops at the same `notAfter`, and a device that missed the pin
update stays stopped. Where the deployment controls its own CA and the collector
certificate is not otherwise constrained, RFC 5280 §4.1.2.5 provides for a
certificate with no well-defined expiry, `99991231235959Z`, and gives an embedded
device as its worked example. Where it does not, pin the next certificate
alongside the current one before the renewal rather than after it. A configured
store turns a missed renewal into delayed delivery rather than lost delivery, up
to the point the store fills.

### Treat endpoint identity as declared, not assumed

The integrator declares the peer identity they expect. A `Stream` verifies it
when one is declared, accepts an explicit decision not to check a name, and
reports when nothing was declared at all - because that last case is a peer that
is chain-verified but otherwise unidentified, which is the case an attacker with
any trusted certificate walks through. BCP 195 §7.1 puts it plainly: without the
name check, TLS proves the certificate is valid and that the peer holds its key,
but not that you reached the endpoint you wanted.

A configured fingerprint is itself a declaration of identity, and a stronger one
than a name: it names the exact certificate expected rather than a subject within
a trusted CA's namespace. So a `Stream` given fingerprints and no name does not
report an unidentified peer.

The states, and what each means, are documented on each platform's configuration
field.

### Obtain credentials per connection, and announce when they are released

Trust anchors, the client credential and the expected peer identity are obtained
when a connection is made, and the `Stream` says when it has finished with them.
Where credentials come from is the integrator's choice, and each platform
documents the mechanism it offers: a file, a caller-built handle, a secure
element, an encrypted store.

Two things follow, and one thing does not.

**A device issued new credentials while it is running uses them on its next
connection** without being restarted. Forcing that reconnection with
`SolidSyslogSender_Disconnect` makes it immediate.

**The window in which the integrator must keep material intact is the
connection**, not the lifetime of the stream. That is the point of announcing the
release: replacing material a stream is still holding is a use-after-free, and an
integrator should not have to infer when it is safe.

**It does not follow that the material is out of RAM for most of the time.** How
much it buys depends on two things the contract cannot settle. The first is how
long a connection lasts, which is covered below. The second is the credential
source: one that hands over a pointer to something the integrator already holds
parted has nothing to release, whereas one that parses on demand and wipes on
release does. Read the platform page for what the source you are wiring actually
does.

What the underlying TLS library holds during a connection is a property of that
library rather than of this contract. Each keeps the parsed certificate and key
for the duration of the session, the private key included, and a `Stream` that
cleared them mid-session would be defeating its own handshake.

The expected identity travels with the destination. Where the destination can be
changed at runtime, redirecting a device to a different collector must carry the
identity its certificate is checked against, or the redirection quietly moves the
device to a peer nobody is verifying.

### A connection is long-lived, and bounding it is yours

A `Stream` opens on the first record that needs it and stays open. It closes when
a send fails, when the destination changes, when the integrator calls
`SolidSyslogSender_Disconnect`, or when the stream is destroyed. There is no idle
timeout and no maximum lifetime, because a syslog client that reconnects on a
timer costs a handshake each time and gains nothing for a device that logs
steadily.

That is the right default and it has a consequence worth stating rather than
leaving to be discovered: **on a device that logs continuously, one connection
may last for the device's uptime, and the credential material stays resident for
all of it.** The private key is needed once, to sign during the handshake; it is
retained for the rest because neither TLS library offers a client a way to hand it
back.

Bounding that window is the integrator's to do, and
`SolidSyslogSender_Disconnect` is how. A deployment that wants the material
resident for minutes rather than months disconnects on its own schedule; the next
record reconnects and the credential source is asked again. The same lever serves
RFC 5425 §4.4's requirement that a sender close a connection it does not expect to
carry more messages.

Where the key must not be in application memory at all, that is a property of the
credential source rather than of the window: a source backed by a secure element
or a hardware key store never hands the key over in the first place.

### Report a partially configured client credential

Mutual TLS is all-or-nothing: a certificate without its key, or a key without its
certificate, is a configuration error and is reported as one. It is never
silently treated as a decision to use server-authenticated TLS, because the
integrator who supplied half a credential believes they have mutual
authentication and does not have it.

A key that does not match the certificate it was supplied with is the same
mistake reached differently, and is detectable without going near the network, so
it is reported at the same point. Left to the handshake, it comes back as a
rejection from the collector, which sends the integrator looking at the collector
for a fault that is on the device.

Delivery continues. The receiver is the enforcement point for our credential - a
collector that requires a client certificate will refuse the handshake, and one
that does not was never going to check. Blocking here would deny the audit trail
without changing what the collector decides.

### Permit the cryptographic level to be chosen

Where the underlying library allows the cipher policy to be selected, a `Stream`
passes the integrator's choice through unchanged and pins none of its own. The
appropriate policy depends on the build present on the target and on the profile
the deployment is held to, and neither is knowable here.

For a deployment with no policy of its own, RFC 9662 §4 asks that
`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` be offered, and BCP 195 §4.2 recommends
the same shape - ECDHE with AES-GCM - for TLS 1.2. Both prefer it over the 2009
mandatory suite, which offers no forward secrecy.

Since no ceiling is set, the version negotiated may be later than the floor, and
a policy that binds only up to the floor does not bind the connection in use.
Passing the integrator's choice through means passing it through for whichever
version is negotiated.

Where the library does not allow it, its own defaults apply. What each platform
can and cannot select is on its page.

### Do not resume a session under weaker terms

A resumed session carries the security parameters of the session it resumes, so a
`Stream` that resumes must check those parameters against what the current
configuration requires and complete a full handshake instead where they fall
short. RFC 5425 §4.2.3 recommends that check; this contract requires it.

A `Stream` that never resumes meets this by construction, and it must not be
possible to start resuming without revisiting the check.

### Do not require revocation checking

Revocation checking is outside the contract. Many industrial deployments have no
route to a certificate revocation list or an OCSP responder, and a control that
depends on reaching one fails closed exactly when the network is the thing under
attack.

An integrator who needs it configures it in their own TLS library and verifies it
themselves. The library neither performs the check nor reports on whether one is
in force.

This is a deliberate deviation, and worth naming as one. BCP 195 §7.5 requires a
TLS implementation to implement a strategy to distrust revoked certificates, and
no stream here implements one. The reasoning is above; what makes it tolerable is
that the obligation moves rather than disappears. An integrator's own TLS library
can be configured for CRL or OCSP, and this library neither performs that check
nor prevents it - so an assessment that needs the obligation met should say where
it is met, rather than assume this library meets it.

It is also why certificate validity is enforced rather than tolerated. Chain,
fingerprint and identity checks all still reject a certificate, but they reject
the same certificate today as they did yesterday. Without a revocation check, the
validity period is the only mechanism by which a certificate that was acceptable
stops being so.

### Bound the handshake

A handshake cannot stall the servicing pass indefinitely. It runs against a
deadline, over a non-blocking transport, and gives up with a report rather than
blocking when the budget expires. That requires an injected sleep, which is why
every TLS `Stream` asks for one.

### Send `close_notify` before tearing down

Closing sends the TLS close notification before the connection goes away, so the
collector can distinguish an orderly shutdown from a truncated session. RFC 5425
§4.4 requires it.

### Check the configuration it cannot work without

A `Stream` is given two kinds of thing, and each is checked at the point it can
be.

**Wiring is checked when the stream is created.** A transport, a sleep, a source
of credentials, and whatever else the platform cannot operate without: given a
configuration missing one of these, a `Stream` reports a bad configuration and
returns the Null object. It does not accept the configuration and then fail on
the first connection, and it does not dereference what is missing. What each
platform cannot work without is on its own page.

**Material is checked when a connection is made**, because that is when it is
obtained. Credentials that cannot be produced, a configuration naming neither
trust anchors nor fingerprints, and a fingerprint that is not well formed are all
reported then, and that connection attempt fails. The sender retries on its next
pass, so a transient source recovers on its own.

This is the library-wide rule for anything that reaches the wire rather than
anything specific to TLS: a failure an integrator caused at setup is reported at
setup, where they are still looking.

### Report every one of these, and name the check that failed

All of the above surface through the error handler rather than a return code an
integrator may not read. [Error handling](error-severity.md) covers what each
severity is telling you; the short form is that `CRITICAL` at create time means
the `Stream` fell back to the Null object and nothing will be delivered.

Where a connection is refused, the report names which check refused it - an
expired certificate, one not yet valid, a chain that does not validate, a
fingerprint that matched nothing, a name that did not match. An integrator whose
device will not connect needs to know which of those it is, because a generic
handshake failure sends them looking at the network for a fault that is on a
certificate.

### Key custody is yours

The library holds no key material of its own and uses whatever it is given. File
permissions on a private key, whether it lives in a hardware security module, and
how it is rotated are properties of your deployment, not of this contract. The
per-connection obligation above is what makes those choices reachable: the
`Stream` asks for material when it needs it and tells you when it is done, so
where the material rests in between is yours to decide.

## Where this stands

These obligations are the target and are not yet met uniformly. Which of them a
given platform meets, and how it falls short where it does not, is on that
platform's own page, because the answer differs between them and only the page
that describes an adapter can state it correctly. Read the page for the platform
you are wiring before you rely on any obligation above.

Six obligations have at least one shipped platform short of them:

| Obligation | Tracked as |
|---|---|
| Authorising a peer by certificate fingerprint | [#753](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/753) |
| Naming the check that refused a connection | [#731](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/731) |
| Obtaining credentials per connection, and choosing where they come from | [E39](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/782) |
| Reporting a partially configured client credential | [#718](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/718), [#719](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/719), [#734](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/734) |
| A cipher policy that binds the negotiated connection | [#733](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/733) |
| Checking the configuration a stream cannot work without | [#732](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/732) |

**Mutual TLS is the one to check before you rely on it.** The shipped platforms
do not behave the same way when a client certificate is supplied without its key,
and one of the two behaviours leaves a device that was configured for mutual TLS
connecting without presenting a certificate.
[E39](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/issues/782) carries the work
that converges them, and the design behind every row above.

No shipped `Stream` resumes a session, so the resumption obligation is met.
