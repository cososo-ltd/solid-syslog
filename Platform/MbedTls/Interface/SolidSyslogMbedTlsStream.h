/** @file
 *  TLS over an injected byte-transport Stream via Mbed TLS, itself a Stream - so
 *  a StreamSender speaks TLS to a remote collector without knowing the transport
 *  underneath, whether a TCP stream from a platform pack or one the caller
 *  supplies.
 *
 *  What the stream does through its vtable is the substance:
 *
 *  - Open first opens the underlying transport, applies the library-owned TLS
 *    policy (client mode, TLS 1.2 floor, VERIFY_REQUIRED), asks the credentials
 *    source to install the material for this connection, installs the peer
 *    identity, then drives the handshake to completion. The
 *    non-blocking transport means each mbedtls_ssl_handshake may want more I/O;
 *    the injected Sleep bridges those polls until the handshake completes, hits
 *    a hard error (HANDSHAKE_REJECTED), or the bounded budget expires
 *    (HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT - re-read from GetHandshakeTimeoutMs each attempt, so a
 *    runtime-tunable value applies on the next reconnect). A failed Open closes
 *    the stream so the sender reconnects on its next pass.
 *  - Send is all-or-nothing: a short write or any TLS error is taken as an
 *    unrecoverable session and closes the stream, so the sender reconnects.
 *  - Read returns the bytes read, 0 for would-block, or closes the stream on any
 *    other TLS return (alert, transport error) - fail-fast, and store-and-forward
 *    replays after the reconnect.
 *
 *  Peer identity is set by ServerName (see the config member). No key material
 *  reaches this stream: it asks its credentials source to install onto the
 *  ssl_config at Open and tells it at Close, so a deployment can keep material
 *  out of memory between connections. Coexistence contract: this adapter touches
 *  only per-instance ssl_config / ssl_context state and never calls
 *  process-global mbedTLS APIs
 *  (platform setup/teardown, psa_crypto_init, threading-alt, debug hooks), so it
 *  drops into an integrator process that already uses Mbed TLS elsewhere. See
 *  docs/platforms/mbedtls/setup.md. */
