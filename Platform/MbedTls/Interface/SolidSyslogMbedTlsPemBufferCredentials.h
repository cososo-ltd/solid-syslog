/** @file
 *  An Mbed TLS credentials backend that parses PEM held in memory, for the
 *  duration of one connection.
 *
 *  Where the handle backend asks the integrator to keep parsed material alive,
 *  this one parses on Install and releases on Close, so between connections
 *  nothing but the integrator's own PEM is in memory. The PEM may live in
 *  read-only flash, or be fetched into a buffer the integrator wipes itself;
 *  this library copies none of it.
 *
 *  What Release frees, Mbed TLS wipes: mbedtls_pk_free zeroises the key context
 *  and every limb of the private key, and mbedtls_x509_crt_free zeroises the
 *  DER it decoded. */
