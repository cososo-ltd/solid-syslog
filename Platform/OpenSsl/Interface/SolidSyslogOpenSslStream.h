/** @file
 *  TLS over an injected byte-transport Stream (OpenSSL reference integration),
 *  for a StreamSender that needs an encrypted channel. The transport (a plain
 *  TcpStream, typically) carries the ciphertext; this stream owns the TLS.
 *
 *  What the stream does through its vtable is the substance:
 *
 *  - Open opens the transport, then builds a fresh SSL_CTX every call (the
 *    cert-rotation contract - a reconnect re-reads the cert/key files), pins the
 *    TLS 1.2 floor, loads CaBundlePath as the trust anchors with SSL_VERIFY_PEER,
 *    wires the transport as a custom BIO, sets SNI + the expected peer identity
 *    from ServerName, and drives the handshake. Any step failing closes the whole
 *    stream so the sender reconnects on its next pass.
 *  - The handshake is a bounded, non-blocking retry: SSL_connect is polled, and
 *    each WANT_READ / WANT_WRITE sleeps briefly via the injected Sleep until the
 *    handshake completes, hits a hard error (rejected), or the deadline from
 *    GetHandshakeTimeoutMs expires (re-read each attempt, so a runtime-tunable
 *    value applies on the next reconnect).
 *  - Send is all-or-nothing over SSL_write: a short write or any error is taken
 *    as a dead connection, so the stream closes itself and the sender reconnects.
 *  - Read returns the bytes read, 0 for would-block (WANT_READ, connection kept),
 *    or closes on anything else - including a mid-stream WANT_WRITE (renegotiation)
 *    which fail-fast semantics treat as a transport failure; store-and-forward
 *    replays after the reopen. */
